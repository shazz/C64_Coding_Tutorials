## Let's take a quick look at the SID Memory Map

I extracted the registers list from one of my prefered source: http://unusedino.de/ec64/technical/aay/c64/sidmain.htm

````

Without going in the details of the registers, we can quickly see some interesting thimgs:
- We have 3 voices
- For each voice, some controls of the ADSR envelop (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release), frequency,... 
- A filter with some controls
- 2 outputs: voice 3 oscillator and envelope generator which are the only ones we can read (if we forget the paddle registers)

## Let's pmake some sound!

To understand a little bit more some of those registers, let's make a small program to play a sound. We'll use the 3rd voice because it may help for the next section. But feel free to try with voice 0 or 1.

The most important concept to understand to start from my point of view: the gate (aka bit 0 of the 3 control registers). The gate is as the name says, the gate between the Delay and the Sustain steps of the note.

![ASDR](ADSR_Envelope_Graph.png)

Or basically, if you consider the C64 as a piano to get a concrete example, the gate is the moment you remove your finder from a key.
So in our little application, we'll set up a counter (using IRQ based on rasterline) to mimic this behavior:
- at a given counter value, we'll push the key: clear the gate and set the voice registers
- at another and latter counter value, weÂ´ll release the key: set the gate so that the Sustain step can start.

Here is a table which is really helpful, the conversion table between hi/lo bytes values for frequencies and musical notes:

Here is the code:

## What about a simple audio analyzer?

As a little exercise, would be great to add some kind of visualization in sync with the music isn't it?
But we don't have access to the SID registers as they are write only, except the upper 8 output bits of Oscillator 3.

Hum... so are we stuck ? Will we have to disassemble the SID Player and modify it?
We could but we can be smarter or at least sneaker. Let's be the man in the middle between the music player routine and the SID chip. How to do that? Don't you remember the previous tutorial where we replayed Cybernoid II?

If you check the code, in order to access the player routine located "behind" the BASIC ROM, we had to disable it using the `$1 Processor Port Register`. If you check again this register, you'll notice something interesting:

````
Bits #0-#2: Configuration for memory areas $A000-$BFFF, $D000-$DFFF and $E000-$FFFF. Values:
%x00: RAM visible in all three areas.

    %x01: RAM visible at $A000-$BFFF and $E000-$FFFF.
    %x10: RAM visible at $A000-$BFFF; KERNAL ROM visible at $E000-$FFFF.
    %x11: BASIC ROM visible at $A000-$BFFF; KERNAL ROM visible at $E000-$FFFF.
    %0xx: Character ROM visible at $D000-$DFFF. (Except for the value %000, see above.)
    %1xx: I/O area visible at $D000-$DFFF. (Except for the value %100, see above.)
...
````

Yes! As we disabled for a few cycles the BASIC ROM, we can also disable temporarly the I/O area where the SID Registers are! (`$D400`-`$D41C`) by setting `%100` to the first 3 bits of this register!

So what we will have to do in our `IRQ`:
 1. Disable the I/O area
 2. Call the SID player as usual which will think to write the SID registers
 3. Copy the SID registers to some temporary RAM location (outside the I/O area)
 4. Enable the I/O area
 5. Copy the saved SID registers to the SID Registers
 6. Plot something nice using the saved registers

## Adding some cool music

This is time to implement this idea and see if it works and doesn't slow down too much our code (by doing 2 copies). Let's use one of my prefered SID tune, "A Mind Is Born" from lft (SID 8580 prefered). Here is the PSID data:

Nothind different from what we learned before:
 1. Init the PSID (`$101C`), no need to disable the KERNAL or the BASIC ROM
 2. Setup the IRQ and call the routine (`$1000`)

Let's now modify the IRQ routine to steal the SID registers values:

````
irq:
	lda #$01
	sta $d019   ; ack the interrupts

    lda #$34    ; Disable I/O ($34 = %0110100) => 100 to disable  
    sta $01

	inc $d020   ; show raster time (start) 
	jsr $1000	; call SID player

    ldx #$18    ; let's copy the 24 SID registers somewhere
save_sid:
    lda $d400,x ; pointer to the RAM area hidden by the SID registers "normally"
    sta $c400,x ; temp space in RAM, nothing here
    dex
    bpl save_sid

	lda #$37 	; Enable the I/O area
    sta $01

    ldx #$18    ; let's restore the 24 SID registers
restore_sid:
    lda $c400,x ; pointer to our temp storage
    sta $d400,x ; real SID registers
    dex
    bpl restore_sid

    dec $d020   ; show raster time (end)

    ; this where we will insert our visualization routine!

	jmp $ea81	; Others can be ended with JMP $EA81, which simply goes to the end of the kernel handler.
````

Ok, the hijacking of the SID registers is in place, let's check it still works!

## Let's sync to the music!

What do we have now to sync a little graphical effect with the music?
 - A copy of the SID registers (inputs)
 - The voice 3 upper 8 bits output

Let's take a look at lft's tune: https://deepsid.chordian.net/?file=/MUSICIANS/L/Lft/A_Mind_is_Born.sid

As you can see the ramping bass line is on voice 3 while the generated melody on voice 2 and the rythm on voice 1.
